These tutorials are primarily a way for me to document my progress as I work through the challenges on <a href="https://hackthissite.org/" target="_blank">HackThisSite.com</a> and continue learning about cybersecurity. If you're interested in taking on these challenges yourself, I highly encourage you to try solving them on your own before looking at my solutions â€” that's what learning is all about. Either way, thanks for stopping by.</p>
